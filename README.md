QOSF Task 2: Shor's code for a two-qubit circuit

Hi, this is my submission for the QOSF mentorship task. The tasK I have chosen is the second task (TASK 2).

For Task 2, I have developed an 18-qubit circuit that fixes a bit-flip error, a phase-flip error and/or both of the two errors mentioned. My solution is in the jupyter file attached to this repo.

Thank you.
